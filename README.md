# Stuff-shop

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This project is my way of learning REACT.JS + REDUX.</p>
<p>Building an online store using React.JS and Redux. From installing the React.js library to deploying a ready-made online store. When working, a fairly large functionality for the site was used: user registration, work with a basket of goods, selections of relevant goods, a list of liked goods. All information for the site was taken from the API.</p>

<p>Design maket is available - <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/7itpNsHVP5LPUpK4ENDYkv/Shop?node-id=0%3A1&t=i8nKSaWzeNTqTOnX-0">here</a></p>
